# cc-load-balancer

An implementation of a simple load-balancer (fifth in a series of coding challenges by John Crickett). This entails no external dependencies. The only built-ins that are used:
- `http`: For listening to the clients requests.
- `urllib`: For forwarding the requests to the servers.
- `sys`: For handling low-level system calls (like exit).
